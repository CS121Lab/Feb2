We got very confused on the last step, "close an issue".
We saw that in the beginning of the step that we were supposed to add and commit the about.html file to our local forked repository
but didn't see that written as an actual step anywhere. So we ended up doing it between "close an issue" and "open an issue". 
It was a bit unclear who was supposed to be doing what, and where.
